# Main System Code
- This is the code that will run on the main system

There are two systems
1. Microcontroller Unit
2. CPU 

### Microcontroller Unit .ino files
This file will be uploaded to the arduino MKR1000

### Python files for CPU
This file will be run on a CPU in a program like Spyder anaconda 

# RUNNING THE TEST
- Place all files in same directory
	- When running a new test delete any other files other than script.py and contacts.txt
- Ensure ArduinoMKR1000 is connected to correct COMPORT eg COM6
	- If not correct COMPORT, change the COM port in the script
- Try to run script as administrator, if not this is okay

## Ensure to have 
Contacts.txt -> file containing e-mails
