# Subsystem development 
The Microncontroller system is divided into subsystems

## Current subsystems code

### ADS1158 ADC Lib
- These files contain arduino code that help to communicate with ADS1158 ADC

### Heating system
- These files contain arduino code to  control the heating system

### Magnetic system
- These files contain arduino code to  control the magnetic system

### CPU Python development
- These files contain individual new/sample functionality that will have new features for the main python program
- Once completed, they are added to the main code

### Arduino .ino functions
- These files contain individual new/sample functionality that will have new features for the arduino MCU system
- Once completed, they are added to the main code
